NGINX-HASKELL
An nginx module for writing request handlers in Haskell

EXAMPLE
Nginx configuration:
    server {
        # ...
        location ~ / {
            haskell MyHaskellModule handler;
        }
    }

Haskell module:
    module MyHaskellModule where

    import qualified Nginx.Core as Nginx
    import qualified Nginx.HTTP sa Nginx

    handler :: Nginx.Request -> IO Nginx.Response
    handler = ...

    foreign export ccall handler :: Nginx.Request -> IO Nginx.Response

IMPLEMENTATION
Currently, the implementation plan involves 3 main pieces:
    o A core NGINX module in C
    o Some Haskell FFI glue to be statically compiled into the core module
    o A collection of modules for writing dynamically Haskell libraries

The user of the module is expected to write dynamic Haskell libraries that use
the `{-# ForeignFunctionInterface #-}` language extension to expose request
handlers and middlewares using `foreign export`.

The types of the exported functions, as well as utilities for working with
these, will be imported from the Haskell modules defined here.

The objective is to use WAI requests and responses to in order to use the
existing ecosystem around them.
